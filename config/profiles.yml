# User Profiles Configuration - Example File
# =============================================================================
# Define profiles for user groups. Each profile can specify:
#   - homepage: Browser start page URL
#   - bookmarks: List of bookmarks (name + url)
#   - autofill: Auto-fill credentials for specific URLs
#   - description: Profile description
#   - priority: Priority level (0 = lowest, higher wins)
#
# The browser type (Firefox/Chromium) is determined by the container image
# configured in broker.yml. Profiles are browser-agnostic.
#
# When deploying with Helm, profiles are configured via values.yaml.
